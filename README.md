## Architecture and Code Structure
Lynket is written on a MVVM Architecture and uses Dagger 2 for dependency injection. The source code is packaged based on feature.

```
app/src/java/<package>
	<feature_1>\
	<feature_2>\
	shared\
	utils\
```
### Architecture
Below outlines sample structure of most screens.

### Code Style

 - [mNo Hungarion notation.](http://jakewharton.com/just-say-no-to-hungarian-notation/)
 - No `Impl` suffixes for interface implementations. Instead name based on what it does. Ex: `AppStore` and implementations `AppDiskStore` and `AppSystemStore`.
 - All new modules are preferred to be written in `Kotlin`
 - Formatting - Android Studio Default.

## Contributions
You are more than welcome to contribute to Lynket's development. New features are branched off of `develop` . PRs are welcome against the `develop` branch. 
How you can help:

 - Grab an issue from [issues](https://github.com/arunkumar9t2/chromer/issues) section that interests you.
 - Unit testing using Roboelectric and Dagger 2 is already setup but coverage is rather low. Adding tests to existing features would greatly help! Refer [src/test/](https://github.com/arunkumar9t2/chromer/tree/master/app/src/test/java/arun/com/chromer).
 - Break the ice. Feel free to create an issue to discuss your ideas.
